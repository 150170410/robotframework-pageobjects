Robot Page Objects API
======================

This is a demo of the Robot Page Object API.

Why?
----

- Robot is great, but it would be nice to encapsulate page/application logic using standard Python OO techniques
without losing the readability inherent in typical Robot Framework test cases.
- It would also be great if we could reuse these Robot page objects in generic unittests

How?
