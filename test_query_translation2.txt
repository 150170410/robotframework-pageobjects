Documentation     Example test cases using the data-driven testing approach.
...
...               Tests use `Calculate` keyword created in this file, that in
...               turn uses keywords in `CalculatorLibrary`. An exception is
...               the last test that has a custom _template keyword_.
...
...               The data-driven style works well when you need to repeat
...               the same workflow multiple times.
...
...               Notice that one of these tests fails on purpose to show how
...               failures look like.
